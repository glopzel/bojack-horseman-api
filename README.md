# bojack-horseman-api

This is an API of Bojack... Horseman obviously. So far it has 50 characters, each with their name, species and voice person. 

## The link almighty

Link to the site: https://bojack-horseman-api.herokuapp.com/ 

This is the link to get to the data: https://bojack-horseman-api.herokuapp.com/api/ 

## How do you look them up? 

All characters were cut to a max of 2 words, because writing Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim-Gerrero-Robinson-Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuack was going to be too much every time, she is just Hollyhock Manheim.
- Character actress Margo Martindale is searched as character actress
- Officer Meow Meow Fuzzyface is Meow Meow.

https://bojack-horseman-api.herokuapp.com/api/maude will result in `{"name":"Maude","voice":"Echo Gillette","species":"Rabbit"} ` 

## How mas it made

#### Tech used

Node.js + Express.js and Heroku. 

## Future Plans

I want to add more characters, the music, seasons and/or episodes.
