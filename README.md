# bojack-horseman-api

This is an API of Bojack... Horseman obviously. So far it has 50 characters, each with their name, species and voice person. 

## The link herself

This is the link to get to the data: https://bojack-horseman-api.herokuapp.com/api/ 

## How do you look them up? 

All characters were cut to a max of 2 words, because writing Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim-Gerrero-Robinson-Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuack was going to be too much every time, she is just Hollyhock Manheim.
Also, character actress Margo Martindale is only searched as character actress. And Officer Meow Meow Fuzzyface is Meow Meow.

https://bojack-horseman-api.herokuapp.com/api/maude will result in `{"name":"Maude","voice":"Echo Gillette","species":"Rabbit"} `  

## How mas it made

#### Tech used: Node.js , Express.js, Heroku

So for this one i used Node.js + Express.js and Heroku, it has 1 HTML page but i'm still unsure if i'll style it or not.

## Future Plans

I want to add more characters, the music, seasons and/or episodes.
